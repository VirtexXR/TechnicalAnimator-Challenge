## The Problem

We have a character model with a non-standard skeleton, we need to set this up so that we can pose the character in a believable way for a sequencer animation.

## The Goal

The goal of this test is not to create an incredibly deep or complex IK/ControlRig.
 
We really want to see your way of thinking and approaching the problem.

In project you will find:
* TestMap
* TestCharacter

## Requirements

System for animating the character as part of a sequencer based animation/custscene.

## Bonuses

* Organise assets and folders as you would normaly
